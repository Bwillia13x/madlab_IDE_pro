# Acceptance Results

Spec source: `madlab_project_spec.ts` not found; proceeded with repo-defined acceptance using E2E flows.

## Results
- A1 Render main interface: BLOCKED (E2E server port collision during Playwright webServer startup)
- A2 Layout persistence after drag/resize: BLOCKED (E2E did not start)
- A3 Preset creation flow: BLOCKED
- A4 Agent chat basic interaction: BLOCKED
- A5 Panel toggles and tabs: BLOCKED

## Evidence
- E2E logs: `reports/overnight_audit/logs/e2e.log`
- Dev server logs: `reports/overnight_audit/logs/dev.log`

## Notes
- Once typecheck/build fixes are applied, E2E should pass based on existing tests in `tests/e2e/workspace.spec.ts`.
