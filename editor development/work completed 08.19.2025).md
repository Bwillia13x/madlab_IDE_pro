const result = await advancedRateLimiter.checkRateLimit(
  'user_123',
  'api_agent',
  2 // cost
);

if (!result.allowed) {
  // Handle rate limit exceeded
  return new Response('Rate limit exceeded', { status: 429 });
}
```

### **Authentication**
```typescript
// Authenticate user
const authResult = await authManager.authenticateUser(
  'user@example.com',
  'password',
  '192.168.1.1',
  'Mozilla/5.0...'
);

if (authResult.success) {
  // User authenticated, proceed with request
  const user = authResult.user;
  const token = authResult.token;
}
```

### **Error Handling**
```typescript
// Handle errors with automatic recovery
try {
  // Your code here
} catch (error) {
  await errorHandler.handleError(error, {
    userId: 'user_123',
    endpoint: '/api/agent',
    method: 'POST',
    severity: 'high'
  });
}
```

### **Performance Optimization**
```typescript
// Cache data with intelligent management
performanceOptimizer.setCache('user_data_123', userData, {
  ttl: 300000, // 5 minutes
  priority: 'high',
  tags: ['user', 'profile'],
  size: 1024
});

// Retrieve cached data
const cachedData = performanceOptimizer.getCache('user_data_123');
```

### **Telemetry Access**
```typescript
// Access system metrics
const rateLimitStats = advancedRateLimiter.getStats();
const authStats = authManager.getAuthStats();
const errorStats = errorHandler.getErrorStats();
