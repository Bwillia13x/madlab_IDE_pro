Here’s a concise audit of implemented capabilities that appear scaffolded but not fully wired into the
running localhost app. Each item lists what exists, where it lives, and what’s missing to surface it
end‑to‑end.

Enterprise

are auto‑registered).

Trading & Backtesting

- Trading engine: Strategy rules, backtests, optimization types; not connected.
  - Files: lib/trading/engine.ts
- Portfolio/positions OMS is wired (PaperTradingConsole, orders), but not to real broker routes.
  - Files: lib/trading/orderManagement.ts (used), lib/trading/positions.ts (used)
  - Missing: Brokerage execution bridge/UI for live.

AI & Insights

UI Routes Hidden From Nav

- Extra pages exist but aren’t linked from the main shell:
  - Paths: /options, /options-chain, /screener, /advanced-charting, /market, /widgets, /watchlist, /presets
  - Evidence: Files in app/*/page.tsx with no links from ActivityBar/GlobalToolbar/CommandPalette.

Extension

- VS Code‑style extension app under apps/extension/ is separate; not wired to the Next.js app UI.
  - Files: apps/extension/*

If you want, I can:

- Wire enterprise middleware into app/api/* and add a minimal auth UI.
- Surface collaboration/marketplace pages in the shell (ActivityBar/CommandPalette).
- Expose provider toggles (IBKR/Alpaca) in DataProviderConfig and lib/data/init.ts.
- Add lightweight UIs for docs generator and risk/microstructure demos.
codex
Below is a ready-to-run agent prompt to integrate the scaffolded features in phases. It is explicit about
goals, sequencing, acceptance criteria, flags, safeguards, and deliverables.

Mission

- Wire scaffolded capabilities into the Next.js app in manageable phases.
- Maintain mock-first fallbacks and safe defaults.
- Add minimal UX affordances to reveal hidden features without destabilizing existing flows.

Guardrails

- Prefer adapters/wrappers over invasive edits; keep changes localized.
- Feature-flag everything; default to off or mock.
- Don’t break SSR/edge constraints; server-only code must stay server-side.
- Keep UI opt-in; expose via ActivityBar/CommandPalette toggles.
- Persist secrets in localStorage/env; never hardcode.
- Tests: add focused unit/integration tests near changed modules only.
- Do not remove existing mock paths; always degrade gracefully.

Environment

- Framework: Next.js App Router, TS, Zustand store in lib/store.ts.
- API routes: app/api/*/route.ts.
- Enterprise libs: lib/enterprise/* (auth, rate limiter, error, perf).
- Data: lib/data/* (providers, init, websocketService).
- Collaboration: lib/collaboration/*.
- Marketplace: lib/marketplace/*.
- Widgets registry: lib/widgets/registry.ts.
- Key UI shells: components/chrome/*, components/panels/*, components/providers/*.

Feature Flags

- Auth: NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_AUTH=true|false
- RateLimit: NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_RATELIMIT=true|false
- Collaboration: NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_COLLAB=true|false
- MarketplaceLaunch: NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_MARKETPLACE_LAUNCH=true|false
- HFT/Aggregator: NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_HFT=true|false
- AdvancedAI: NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_ADV_AI=true|false
- Microstructure: NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_MICROSTRUCTURE=true|false
- DocsUI: NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_DOCS=true|false

Phase 0 — Recon & Baseline

- Objectives:
  - Inventory routes, providers, and store APIs.
  - Capture current behavior and tests as baseline.
- Actions:
  - Map API handlers in app/api/*/route.ts.
  - Confirm provider bootstrap in lib/data/init.ts.
  - Grep usage of authManager, advancedRateLimiter, errorHandler, performanceOptimizer.
- DoD:
  - Short summary doc listing entry points and proposed injection points.
  - No code changes.

Phase 1 — Enterprise Middleware (Auth, RateLimit, Error, Perf)

- Objectives:
  - Introduce wrappers for API handlers to add auth, rate limiting, error capture.
- Actions:
  - Add lib/enterprise/withEnterprise.ts with composable wrappers:
  - `withAuth(handler, { optional: true })`
  - `withRateLimit(handler, { policyId })`
  - `withErrorHandling(handler)`
  - `compose(handler, ...wrappers)`
- Wrap app/api/*/route.ts handlers (excluding health) using compose.
- Add middleware.ts to apply coarse auth to /api/(?!health) when FEATURE_AUTH on.
- Expose basic login/logout endpoints if needed: app/api/auth/*.
- UI:
  - Add minimal login modal behind CommandPalette action; store token in memory with fallback mock.
- DoD:
  - API routes run with wrappers; unauthenticated allowed by default unless flag forces.
  - Rate limiter counters update; error stats visible in Telemetry.
  - Tests: wrapper unit tests + one wrapped route integration test.

Phase 2 — Provider UX & Secrets

- Objectives:
  - Expose IBKR/Alpaca toggles in DataProviderConfig; wire init paths.
- Actions:
  - Extend components/providers/DataProviderConfig.tsx to accept:
  - AlphaVantage, Polygon (existing), plus Alpaca (key/secret/paper), IBKR (host/port/clientId).
- Persist credentials under names already used in init:
  - `madlab_alpha-vantage_apikey`, `madlab_polygon_apikey`
  - `madlab_alpaca_apikey`, `madlab_alpaca_secret`, `madlab_alpaca_paper`
  - `madlab_ib_host`, `madlab_ib_port`, `madlab_ib_clientId`
- Update lib/data/init.ts to conditionally call addAlpacaProvider and addIBKRProvider when keys present.
- UI:
  - CommandPalette commands to “Switch Provider” and “Clear Provider Credentials”.
- DoD:
  - Switching providers updates store and provider registry without reload.
  - Mock remains default; real providers used when present.
  - Tests: provider init function tests (keys → providers map).

Phase 3 — Collaboration (Workspace Sync + Team + Editor)

- Objectives:
  - Surface Collaboration Dashboard and optional sync.
- Actions:
  - Add /collaboration route mounting components/collaboration/CollaborationDashboard.tsx.
  - Add ActivityBar icon and CommandPalette item to open Collaboration.
  - Wire lib/collaboration/workspaceSync.ts behind FEATURE_COLLAB:
  - Bootstrap WS connection if `NEXT_PUBLIC_SYNC_WS_URL` exists; otherwise no-op.
- Export minimal “Invite” and “Join” flows as local no-ops when backend absent.
- DoD:
  - Collaboration page reachable; status badge shows connection status (mock ok).
  - No runtime errors when WS/env missing; UI shows disabled state.
  - Tests: smoke test renders dashboard; sync service no-op path tested.

Phase 4 — Marketplace (Launch Orchestration)

- Objectives:
  - Integrate MarketplaceLaunch for creator/campaign metrics in Marketplace panel.
- Actions:
  - Extend components/panels/MarketplacePanel.tsx with a “Creators” and “Campaigns” tab:
  - Use `lib/marketplace/launch.ts` to list creators/campaigns.
- Add admin-only CommandPalette entries for creating/updating campaigns (guard by flag).
- Keep in-memory; no backend persistence required yet.
- DoD:
  - Marketplace panel shows mock creators/campaigns; metrics computed.
  - TemplateUploadDialog continues to use templateSharingService.
  - Tests: unit tests for MarketplaceLaunch methods.

Phase 5 — Advanced Data (HFT Handler + Multi-Exchange)

- Objectives:
  - Pipe data through highFrequencyHandler and multiExchangeAggregator optionally.
- Actions:
  - Extend lib/data/websocketService.ts to emit into highFrequencyHandler.
  - Add lib/data/aggregatorBridge.ts to route combined updates into multiExchangeAggregator.
  - Create a lightweight “Market Ticker (HFT)” widget to visualize throughput/compression stats.
- DoD:
  - With FEATURE_HFT on, handler metrics update in real time (mock or WS).
  - Aggregated mid/BB/BA available in bridge; widget renders basic stats.
  - Tests: unit tests for handler batching/compression toggles.

Phase 6 — Advanced AI Exposure

- Objectives:
  - Make advancedAI visible via existing or new widget.
- Actions:
  - Update components/widgets/PredictiveInsights.tsx to optionally call:
  - `advancedAI.analyzeMarketSentiment`, `generateMarketPredictions`, `detectTechnicalPatterns`
  - Gate by `FEATURE_ADV_AI`; use try/catch and fall back to existing insights engine.
- Add CommandPalette action “Toggle Advanced AI Insights”.
- DoD:
  - PredictiveInsights renders additional cards when flag is on; silently degrades off.
  - Tests: unit test the glue function that combines basic/advanced insights.

Phase 7 — Market Microstructure

- Objectives:
  - Visualize lib/market/microstructure.ts.
- Actions:
  - Add “Order Book & Microstructure” widget that consumes simulated order book and metrics.
  - Register widget in lib/widgets/registry.ts and schema.ts.
- DoD:
  - Widget loads with mock data; can point to live when available.
  - Tests: deterministic simulation unit test for one metric function.

Phase 8 — Docs UI

- Objectives:
  - Add Docs page to read generated docs.
- Actions:
  - Add /docs route that lists docs/*.md at build/runtime (server-only read).
  - Add API route POST /api/docs/generate to invoke DocumentationGenerator in dev mode only.
  - CommandPalette: “Open Docs”, “Regenerate Docs” (dev only).
- DoD:
  - Docs render locally; generator guarded (no-op in prod).
  - Tests: generator unit test (already exists); add route smoke test.

Phase 9 — Reveal Hidden Routes

- Objectives:
  - Make existing pages discoverable.
- Actions:
  - Add CommandPalette shortcuts for /widgets, /options, /options-chain, /screener, /advanced-charting, /
  - Optional: add a simple “Views” dropdown in GlobalToolbar for quick navigation.
- DoD:
  - Pages open from palette; no dead links.

Phase 10 — Telemetry & Observability Polish

- Objectives:
  - Ensure new layers contribute metrics to Telemetry dashboard.
- Actions:
  - Emit rate limit stats, auth sessions, perf cache hit rate (already read in Telemetry).
  - Add counters from HFT handler and aggregator to Telemetry “Performance” tab.
- DoD:
  - Telemetry lists new counters; no UI regressions.

Deliverables Per Phase

- Code: minimal, focused patches, feature-flagged.
- UX: palette entries and/or ActivityBar icons.
- Config: documented env/LS keys.
- Tests: narrow unit/integration tests.
- Notes: short summary of wiring points and rollbacks.

Acceptance Criteria (Global)

- No regression in default mock experience.
- All new capabilities are discoverable via CommandPalette.
- Flags off → identical behavior to baseline; flags on → new flows visible.
- Errors are captured in errorHandler with improved Telemetry visibility.
- Provider switching and credentials management work without reload.

Risk Mitigations

- Server-only file access limited to API routes; no fs in client.
- WebSocket absence handled by no-ops and disabled UI states.
- Provider keys optional; mock remains always-on fallback.
- Wrappers (auth/ratelimit/error) preserve original handler return shapes.

Quick Start Commands

- Enable a feature: set NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_* in .env.local and restart.
- Open palette: press Cmd/Ctrl+K to navigate to new views and toggles.
- Test focus: run pnpm test -t "Enterprise|MarketplaceLaunch|AdvancedAIFeatures" (adjust to your test
runner).

If you want, I can convert this prompt into actionable Git patches starting with Phase 1 (enterprise
wrappers) and Phase 2 (provider UX).
