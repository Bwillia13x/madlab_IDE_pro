**MAD LAB Platform Completeness Status**
- Date: 2025-08-20
- Scope: Web app (Next.js), widget system, data layer, AI agent scaffolding, trading/backtesting stubs, PWA/performance, VS Code extension, testing/CI.

**Executive Summary**
- Overall: Core workbench UI, widget framework, performance, and packaging are production-grade. Data/provider wiring, AI agent to LLM, and several integrations remain partial. MVP is within reach pending targeted integration and hardening.
- Readiness: Core UX 95%, Performance 95–99%, Widget system 85–90%, Data providers 60–70%, Agent 50–60%, Collaboration 50–60%, Trading/backtest 60–70%, QA/integration 70–85%.
- Primary gaps to MVP: End-to-end real data provider enablement (at least one), basic auth/session + settings persistence, agent actions + limited LLM capability, minimal collaboration (workspace sync, single-room), and a focused “happy-path” E2E suite.

**Key Features Implemented**
- Workbench UI: VS Code-inspired chrome, grid, tabs, theme system, URL/local layout persistence, responsive + mobile components.
- Widget System: Registry + schema-driven config; rich set of finance widgets (valuation, risk, options, charts, portfolio, analytics).
- Data Layer: Provider registry with adapters for mock, Alpha Vantage, Polygon, Alpaca, Interactive Brokers (real/sim); realtime hooks; cache and HFT handlers; multi-exchange aggregator.
- AI & Agent: Natural language query parser; agent scaffold that fetches via provider and synthesizes responses; basic backtesting utilities.
- Trading: Engine skeleton with orders/positions/portfolio types; paper-trading console widget; risk monitoring dashboard.
- Performance & PWA: Service worker, manifest, preloading, monitoring of Core Web Vitals, bundle optimizations; Lighthouse reports show 0.95–0.99 scores after Phase 3.
- Extension: VS Code extension loads static export or bundled assets; bridges workspace sync, settings, mock agent responses, and data calls with SecretStorage for API keys.
- Quality & Tooling: Vitest unit tests, Playwright E2E, CI workflows, deployment guide, local test report indicating functional demo on localhost.

**Current Status by Area**
- UI/UX and Layout: Complete. Responsive, themed, and persistent layouts; mobile views implemented.
- Widgets: Broad catalog implemented and interactive. Some widgets rely on mock or partial data; advanced configuration is in progress.
- Data Providers: Mock fully working. Real provider adapters exist; initialization/wiring in `lib/data/init.ts` is stubbed. Provider selection persisted via store; capabilities defined.
- Realtime Data: Hooks and websocket scaffolding present; provider-specific streaming needs end-to-end testing with credentials.
- AI Agent: Parser and agent orchestration present; extension provides mock LLM responses. Real LLM integration and safe action routing remain.
- Trading/Backtesting: Usable mock backtesting via extension; trading engine types and flows scaffolded; no live brokerage integration wired into UI.
- Collaboration: Workspace sync/team manager modules exist; UI doesn’t expose multi-user flows; server signaling not configured.
- Performance: Phase 2/3 reports show major improvements; PWA assets in place; monitoring component included.
- Testing: Foundational suites strong; integration path indicates mocking gaps for LLM/provider injection; some Playwright reports captured.
- Packaging/Release: Extension packaging workflow; CI/CD present; deployment guide covers server setup.

**MVP Definition (Proposed for This Project)**
- Workbench: Stable desktop UI with mobile fallback; theme; persistent layouts.
- Data: One real market data provider enabled end-to-end (historical + basic realtime for equity prices) selectable in settings.
- Widgets: Core set functional on live data (KPI, line/candlestick, options chain basic, portfolio tracker, news stub optional).
- Agent: Command routing for a few actions (add widget, load preset) + narrow LLM flow with safe prompts, or extension-based mock in demo mode.
- Trading: Paper trading with simple PnL tracking; no live orders.
- Collaboration: Minimal workspace share/sync for one room or URL-based snapshot sharing.
- QA: Green unit tests + a small happy-path E2E suite (load app, switch provider, render live chart, add widget, save/restore).
- Ops: ENV-driven config, deployable on Vercel or Node server; basic error telemetry and performance monitors.

**Gaps to Close for MVP**
- Real Data Wiring
  - Alpha Vantage: Initialize in `lib/data/init.ts`, expose API key inputs in settings, verify `getPrices/getKpis` across widgets.
  - Polygon (optional for MVP): Gate options chain and realtime via key; mock fallback remains.
  - Acceptance: Chart and KPI widgets render for `AAPL` with real data within 3s.
- Settings & Persistence
  - UI to set provider + keys (web), persist to localStorage; extension already supports SecretStorage for keys.
  - Acceptance: Restart app retains provider and key, no console errors.
- Agent Minimal Actions
  - Implement action router for: add widget, switch preset, explain chart; wire to a constrained LLM handler or keep extension mock for demo mode.
  - Acceptance: From Agent panel, “add advanced-chart” updates grid reliably.
- Realtime Path
  - Verify websocket streaming path for selected provider; fallback to polling when unavailable.
  - Acceptance: Price stream updates chart at ≤1s cadence; auto-reconnect works.
- Trading/Backtest Polishing
  - Surface backtest runner in a widget with params; persist results for session; clarify mock labeling.
  - Acceptance: Backtest completes under 3s with predictable output.
- Collaboration Minimal
  - Enable workspace share URL or simple WS room sync via `lib/collaboration/workspaceSync.ts` in a controlled scope.
  - Acceptance: Two tabs mirror layout changes within 1s on localhost.
- Integration Tests
  - Fix LLM/provider mocking; add happy-path Playwright E2E for MVP flow; ensure CI runs them.
  - Acceptance: CI green on unit + minimal E2E; no flaky steps.

**Risk/Considerations**
- API limits and quota: Respect rate limiting; implement caching/backoff.
- Secrets handling: Never expose keys client-side; keep demo mode default with clear banner.
- Licensing/data ToS: Provider terms for redistribution/storage.
- Performance regressions: Maintain budgets and Lighthouse checks in CI.
- Accessibility: Keep keyboard nav and ARIA from shadcn/ui patterns.

**Suggested Implementation Order (2–4 days)**
- Day 1: Alpha Vantage initialization + settings UI; wire widgets to provider; add mock fallback.
- Day 2: Agent action router + 2–3 actions; realtime verification/polling fallback; paper backtest widget polish.
- Day 3: Minimal collaboration path; finalize E2E happy path; fix test mocks; tighten error handling.
- Day 4: Docs, cleanup, test stability; verify PWA/perf budgets; release notes + extension package.

**Quick How-To Validate**
- Configure provider: Set API key (web settings or extension), choose provider in settings.
- Render data: Add Line/Candlestick widget for AAPL; confirm live/historical data loads.
- Agent test: Ask agent to add an “advanced-chart”; observe grid update.
- Realtime: Watch chart ticks for a few minutes; confirm no console errors.
- Collaboration: Open second tab (if enabled) and drag a tile; observe sync.
- CI: Run `pnpm test` and Playwright happy-path.

**Conclusion**
- The platform is feature-rich and performant with strong scaffolding across data, AI, trading, and collaboration. The path to MVP is primarily about enabling one real data provider end-to-end, adding a minimal yet safe agent action loop, and closing integration/testing gaps. With focused effort, MVP is achievable in a short sprint.
