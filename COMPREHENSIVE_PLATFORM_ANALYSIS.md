// Required but missing keyboard shortcuts:
- Alt+1: Toggle Explorer panel ‚ùå
- Alt+3: Toggle Agent Chat panel ‚ùå
- Cmd/Ctrl+D: Duplicate widget ‚ùå
- Delete/Backspace: Remove widget ‚ùå
- Esc: Clear selection ‚ùå
```

- No 1px #007acc outline when selected
- Selection state not properly managed
- Inspector integration broken

### 3.3 Explorer Panel Issues
- Fixed width (not resizable as required)
- Missing draggable resize handle
- `explorerWidth` state not applied to component

### 3.4 StatusBar Content Missing
```typescript
// Current: Generic VS Code info
// Required: Active sheet + widget count, "Local ¬∑ Read-Only" + clock
```

### 3.5 Inspector Integration Broken
- Inspector exists but not connected to widget selection
- Missing "Configure" action in widget kebab menus
- No automatic opening when widget selected

**Accessibility Strengths:**

## 10. Conclusions & Recommendations

### Overall Platform Assessment

The MAD LAB Workbench demonstrates **strong technical fundamentals** with excellent financial modeling capabilities and a well-architected foundation. However, **critical UX gaps** prevent immediate beta launch readiness.

### Key Strengths
1. **Professional Financial Modeling**: Comprehensive DCF, options, and risk analysis
2. **Solid Architecture**: Modern tech stack with clean separation of concerns
3. **Security**: Well-implemented security headers and API key management
4. **Test Coverage**: Strong unit test foundation for business logic

### Critical Weaknesses
1. **Incomplete UX**: Missing essential IDE behaviors and interactions
2. **E2E Test Failures**: 77% of integration tests failing
3. **Performance Issues**: Widget render times exceeding budgets
4. **Integration Gaps**: Inspector not connected to widget selection

### Final Recommendation

**DO NOT PROCEED** with beta launch until **Priority 1 critical gaps** are resolved. The platform has excellent potential but needs 2-3 weeks of focused UX development to achieve beta readiness.

**Estimated Time to Beta Ready**: **3-4 weeks** with dedicated development effort on core UX behaviors and test stabilization.

The foundation is solid and the financial capabilities are impressive, but user experience must be completed before external beta testing can begin successfully.
